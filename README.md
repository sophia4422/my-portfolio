# Welcome to Sophia's Portfolio

Hello! My name is Sophia Wall. This is my very first css / html project where I have had 100% of the creative freedom.

I have created a personal portfolio using only CSS and HTML via VSCODE, in order to tell you more about me and showcase my work. Please click here to see the deployed Portfolio:

# The Brief

1. Build a styled portfolio from scratch
2. Build it in a way that it can be updated as my skills develop
3. Use all of the concepts learned so far (e.g. semantic elements, flex boxes, CSS variables etc)
4. Add all deployed projects and make placeholders for future ones
5. When it loads, the portfolio shows my name and a photo
6. The nav bar takes the guest to 3 different sections: about me, my work and contact
7. In the 'my work' section, the first application should be larger in size than the others
8. When the applications are clicked, the guest is taken to the deployed application
9. When the screen is resized, the webpage is responsive and adapts to the view port

# Beginning the Process

I had an idea in my head of how I wanted the portfolio to look and I began drawing it out on paper - as this is how I work best. I love the beach and I knew that wanted my portfolio to reflect that.

Where to begin? I had no code to go off of, I had to rely on all of my knowledge learnt so far. I made a html file, an assets folder, a css file and linked my css/html together. Add, commit, push. Now what?

Staying focussed, I marked out where all of my divs will go, following with the sketch I had drew out on paper. Remembering what my instructor had told me, it is wise to begin from the top and work my way down, so I began with the nav bar - and off I went!

# The Theme

As mentioned earlier, I wanted my portfolio to be inspired by the beach. I chose sea-foam, neutral colours and added a picture of myself in Kefalonia, Greece (in the distance you can see an island, that is Zante). My logo is of a tropical hibiscus flower. The serif font I chose kind of reminds me of pirate handwriting(?) and the sans-serif font compliments this nicely. The curved svg has been added to resemble waves.
