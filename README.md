# Welcome to Sophia's Portfolio

Hello! My name is Sophia Wall. This is my very first css / html project where I have had 100% of the creative freedom.

I have created a personal portfolio using only CSS and HTML via VSCODE, in order to tell you more about me and showcase my work. Please click here to see the deployed Portfolio:

# The Brief

1. Build a styled portfolio from scratch
2. Build it in a way that it can be updated as my skills develop
3. Use all of the concepts learned so far (e.g. semantic elements, flex boxes, CSS variables etc)
4. Add all deployed projects and make placeholders for future ones
5. When it loads, the portfolio shows my name and a photo
6. The nav bar takes the guest to 3 different sections: about me, my work and contact
7. In the 'my work' section, the first application should be larger in size than the others
8. When the applications are clicked, the guest is taken to the deployed application
9. When the screen is resized, the webpage is responsive and adapts to the view port

# Beginning the Process

I had an idea in my head of how I wanted the portfolio to look and I began drawing it out on paper - as this is how I work best. I love the beach and I knew that wanted my portfolio to reflect that.

Where to begin? I had no code to go off of, I had to rely on all of my knowledge learnt so far. I made a html file, an assets folder, a css file and linked my css/html together. Add, commit, push. Now what?

Staying focussed, I marked out where all of my divs will go, following with the sketch I had drew out on paper. Remembering what my instructor had told me, it is wise to begin from the top and work my way down, so I began with the nav bar - and off I went!

# The Theme

As mentioned earlier, I wanted my portfolio to be inspired by the beach. I chose sea-foam, neutral colours and added a picture of myself in Kefalonia, Greece (in the distance you can see an island, that is Zante). My logo is of a tropical hibiscus flower. The serif font I chose kind of reminds me of pirate handwriting(?) and the sans-serif font compliments this nicely. The curved svg has been added to resemble waves.

# Meeting the Brief

For a beginner to CSS/HTML, I am proud of what I have achieved so far with this project. I have been working at it every day and I really like how the outcome looks on desktop.

However, number 9 of the brief, has been a real uphill struggle. I completed my webpage and - despite being told to style my webpage for mobile FIRST - I thought that adding a simple media query at the end would fix all my problems. I was wrong.

I have been trying to make my webpage look correct when resizing and I have been getting nowhere. The only part of my page that I have managed to look somewhat decent when resized is my navbar - each element stacks on top of each other and I have hidden the logo.

As you can see from my css code, I have tried addressing each element under the media query and trying to change them - e.g. adding 'flex-wrap' to my projects boxes did at one point make them all stack in line when resized, but now it does not work.

This is a very important part of web-design - I will get it and I will fix it. But until I can ask for some help, I have had to stop for fear of it ruining how the webpage looks on desktop. I have learnt from my mistakes and know for next time.

When you hover over the project icons, a title and description appears:

The contact me section uses hyperlinked icons to take the guest to my github or linked in.
